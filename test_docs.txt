November Experiment Notes:
No spin adaptation unless specified:

11/2/21
-------
H6 ADAPT 3A, 300 Initializations: h6_3A_adapt.inp

11/4/21
-------
H4 ADAPT 3A, 1 Initialization: h4_3A_adapt.inp

H4 ADAPT 3A, (Doubling h4_3A_adapt.inp result): h4_overparam.inp

H6 ADAPT 1A, 300 Initializations: h6_1A_adapt.inp
(Wanted version with HF guess contained in it so my parsing is more applicable)

11/5/21
-------
H6 ADAPT 3A, Recycled ADAPT Starting from 15 operators at a random point (no optimization of 15 parameters):
Seed = 1: h6_3A_15_1.inp

11/8/21
-------
H6 ADAPT 3A, 300 Initializations, 1-|Psi><Psi| as objective function:  h6_3A_overlap.inp

H6 ADAPT 3A, Recycled ADAPT Starting from 15 operators at a random point:
Seed = 2: h6_3A_15_2.inp
Seed = 3: h6_3A_15_3.inp
Seed = 4: h6_3A_15_4.inp
Seed = 5: h6_3A_15_5.inp

--------Git should contain all inputs/outputs up to here---------

H6 1-Up 300 guesses: h6_1up.inp

H6 2-Up 300 guesses: h6_2up.inp

H6 3-Up 300 guesses: h6_3up.inp

Geometry optimizers for LiH, BeH2 (B3LYP/6-31G*):  lih_optimizer.py, beh2_optimizer.py (Ran on my machine)

LiH ADAPT 1.62A, 300 Initializations: lih.inp

BeH2 ADAPT 1.33A, 300 Initializations: beh2.inp

H4 ADAPT 1A, 300 Initializations: h4_1A_300.inp

H4 ADAPT 3A, 300 Initializations: h4_3A_300.inp

h6_spec.py on my machine used to get excited spectra for all these systems.

11/11/21

BeH2 ADAPT 1.33A, 1 Initialization, Spin-adapted (to compare to Nick's): lone_beh2.inp

Restarted beh2.inp after cutting some analysis stuff that was slowing down my code

11/12/21

Restarted h4_3A_300.inp so that the log file would stop at Etol = 1e-10 instead of going on forever
