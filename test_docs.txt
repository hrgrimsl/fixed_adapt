November Experiment Notes:
No spin adaptation unless specified:

11/2/21
-------
H6 ADAPT 3A, 300 Initializations: h6_3A_adapt.inp

11/4/21
-------
H4 ADAPT 3A, 1 Initialization: h4_3A_adapt.inp

H4 ADAPT 3A, (Doubling h4_3A_adapt.inp result): h4_overparam.inp

H6 ADAPT 1A, 300 Initializations: h6_1A_adapt.inp
(Wanted version with HF guess contained in it so my parsing is more applicable)

11/5/21
-------
H6 ADAPT 3A, Recycled ADAPT Starting from 15 operators at a random point (no optimization of 15 parameters):
Seed = 1: h6_3A_15_1.inp

11/8/22
-------
H6 ADAPT 3A, 300 Initializations, 1-|Psi><Psi| as objective function:  h6_3A_overlap.inp

H6 ADAPT 3A, Recycled ADAPT Starting from 15 operators at a random point:
Seed = 2: h6_3A_15_2.inp
Seed = 3: h6_3A_15_3.inp
Seed = 4: h6_3A_15_4.inp
Seed = 5: h6_3A_15_5.inp

--------Git should contain all inputs/outputs up to here---------
